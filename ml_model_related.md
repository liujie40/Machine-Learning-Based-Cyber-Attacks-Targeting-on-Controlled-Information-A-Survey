## Stealing controlled ML model related information

### ML-based Stealing Attack

***
<p>Leveraging the query inputs and outputs, model description can be stolen by equation-solving, patch-finding and linear least square methods, while training samples can be stolen by model inversion attack, the GAN attack, and membership inference attack.</p>
