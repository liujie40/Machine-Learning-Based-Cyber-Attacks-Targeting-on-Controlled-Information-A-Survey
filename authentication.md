## Stealing controlled authentication information

### ML-based Stealing Attack

***
<p>The controlled authentication information mainly contains keystroke data, secret keys and password data. As shown in Fig 4, classification models or probabilistic models are trained to steal the controlled authentication information. Leveraging the acceleration, acoustic and video information, we review the attack stealing these keystroke information. We also investigate the attack stealing controlled secret key information via analyzing the state of targeted cache set. Moreover, we study the password guessing attack by analyzing the password patterns with ML techniques.</p>
